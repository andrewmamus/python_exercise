# EXERCISE QUESTIONS

1.  Write a program to find the area of a circle, given that the area of a circle is pi*r² 

2.  Evaluate the following expressions, giving that a = 6, b = 5, and c = 2.
    -   -5 * (781 % 3) + 4 * (1.6 + 2.9 / 2) – ( (19 // 5) % 2)
    -   4 * ( ( a % 5) * (4 + ( b – 3))) / ((c + 2) **2 )
    -   NOT FLAG AND (((P * Q) > R) OR ((P + Q) < R))
        where P = 5.0, Q = 6.0, R = 8.0 and FLAG = True
    -   Suppose A = 4, B = 7 and C = 2, find the values of D and M, given that
        D = NOT (A + B > 12) OR (B – A < 2)
        M = (A < B) AND (B < C) OR (B = A)

3.  Write a program that reads the marks of a student and displays PASS or FAIL. It displays FAIL if marks are less than 40 else display PASS.

4.  Write a program that reads the students ‘registration number & his GPA and then print a message     according to class of his GPA.

5.  Write a program that reads two integer numbers and print the maximum number among them.

6.  **Write an appropriate IF – THEN – ELSE statement for the following:**
    Test the value of the variable hours. If hours is less than or equal to 40, assign 4.50 to pay and assign “Regular” to the variable status. If pay exceeds 40, assign 6.25 to pay and assign “overtime” to status.

7.  Write a program that will calculate the discount and amount to be paid by the customer, given that if the sales is less than N50,000 then discount is 5% of the sales otherwise discount is 10%.

8.  Write a program that calculates the sum as well as the average score of 10 students in a class using for-loop statement.

9.  Write a program that reads the rate of pay per hour of an employee and reads the hours worked using while-loop statement. Calculates the gross wage and display the output on the screen.

10. Write a program that reads the score of 10 subjects of 20 students. Calculte the sum of scores, and display the names and average.
